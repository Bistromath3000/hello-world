# hello-world
first repository

History repeats the old conceits
the glib replies
the same defeats

Keep your finger on hot button issues
with crocodile tears 
and a pocket full of tissues

I'm just an oily slick 
in a wind-up world
where the millers tick

...

so in this almost empty gin palace
through a two-way looking glass 
you see your Alice
